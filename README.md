# week-2-assignment

Reflection:

I could not get my code to work as intended and have not achieved any required goals, other than adding appropriate alt text to images used.

I found this project difficult and do not feel positive about my submission. I'm frustrated because I know the logic of what is being asked but I just don't have the ability or knowledge at present to complete the task in coding language. I managed to get as far as writing the functions in Javascript for thumbnail generation and full-size image generation and linked an array to them.



























Assignment Brief:

Week 2 assignment - Build an accessible image gallery

Instructions
User Stories
🐿️ As a user, I want the website design to adjust using media queries so that it works well on both small mobile screens and larger desktop screens.
🐿️ As a user with accessibility needs, I expect accessible considerations like alternative text for images so my screen reader can interpret and convey the content to me effectively.
🐿️ As a user, I want to easily switch between images in the gallery using buttons so that my experience is smooth and intuitive.
Requirements
🎯 Implement responsive design using media queries to ensure the website works well on both small mobile screens and larger desktop screens (e.g., above 800px).
🎯 Ensure all images have appropriate alt text attributes for accessibility.
🎯 Correctly use event handlers to switch images based on user interactions.

Here is some psudeo-code…

How to Deploy
Once everything is added, committed and pushed to GitHub:

Go to the project GitHub repo
Go to ‘Settings’
In the sidebar, go to ‘Pages’
In ‘Build and Deployment’ > ‘Branch’, select the ‘main’ branch from the drop-down and save
Wait a minute or so, and your website is deployed!
Stretch Goals
To achieve a 4/4 in your assignment, aim to achieve all of the requirements, plus something extra. This can be excellence in styling or something that demonstrates creativity or innovation in the week’s topics.

Below are some examples of stretch goals and user stories that you could add to your project, but are not expected to.

Stretch User Stories
🐿️ As a user, I want the website to use ‘srcset’ to display appropriately sized images for my device, so that images load quickly and look sharp on any screen.
🐿️ As a user with accessibility needs, I want ARIA elements, such as aria-label, aria-live, and other relevant attributes, to improve my interaction with the website.
🐿️ As a user, I want to use keyboard shortcuts, like arrow keys, to switch between images easily.
🐿️ As a user on various devices, I want the website to adapt to different screen sizes through the use of media queries for an optimal viewing experience.
Stretch Requirements
🏹 Use ‘srcset’ to specify which image will be used based on the size of the screen for optimal viewing experience.
🏹 Add ARIA elements to improve accessibility, such as aria-label, aria-live, and other relevant attributes.
🏹 Implement key bindings for buttons to enhance navigation, such as using arrow keys to switch between images.
🏹 Develop media queries for multiple screen sizes.
